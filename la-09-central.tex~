  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> A \alert{population} is the complete collection of all
    measurements or data that are being considered.
  \item<2-> A \alert{census} is the collection of data from every
    member of the population.
  \item<3-> A \alert{sample} is a subcollection of members selected
    from a population.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introductory Concepts in Statistics II}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> A \alert{voluntary response sample} or
    \alert{self-selected sample} is one in which the respondents
    themselves decide whether to be included.
  \item<2-> A \alert{random sample} is one in which each member has
    the same probability of being selected.
  \item<3-> A \alert{stratified random sample} is one in which random
    samples from subgroups are drawn and proportionally combined to
    form the complete sample.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introductory Concepts in Statistics III}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> A \alert{parameter} is a numerical measurement describing
    some characteristic of the population.
  \item<2-> A \alert{statistic} is a numerical measurement describing
    some characteristic of a sample.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introductory Concepts in Statistics IV}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> \alert{Quantitative} (or \alert{numerical}) data consist
    of numbers representing counts or measurements.
  \item<2-> \alert{Categorical} (or \alert{qualitative}) data consist
    of names or labels that are not numbers representing counts or
    measurements.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introductory Concepts in Statistics V}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> \alert{Discrete} data result when the data values are
    quantitative and the number of values is finite or countable.
  \item<2-> \alert{Continuous} data result when the data values are
    quantitative and the number of values is infinite and not
    countable.
  \end{itemize}
Here is an example for infinite discrete outcomes (this is rare). Roll
a die until you roll a six. There are infinitely many ways to do this,
but the data is not continuous.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Introductory Concepts in Statistics VI}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> \alert{Blinding} is when the subject doesn't know whether
    they are receiving a treatment or a placebo.
  \item<2-> The \alert{placebo effect} occurs when an untreated
    subject reports an improvement in symptoms because of their
    participation in the study.
  \item<3-> An experiment is \alert{double-blind} when it is blind and
    the experimenter also doesn't know whether they are applying a
    treatment or a placebo.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Correlation Does Not Imply Causation}
\alert{Confounding} occurs in an experiment when the investigators are
not abloe to distinguish among the effects of different factors.

Examples: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> astrological sign and IQ in elementary school
\item<2-> soft drinks and obesity
\item<3-> birth control pills and thrombosis
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Characterizing Data Sets}
  The following serve to characterize data sets without listing the
  data:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item measures of centre
  \item measures of dispersion
  \item measures of position
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measures of Centre: Mean}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:daechuev}
    \mbox{mean}=\frac{\sum{}x}{n}
  \end{equation}
  where $n$ is the number of data points in your quantitative data set
  and $x$ is your data set. Mathematically speaking, $x$ is an
  $n$-dimensional vector $x=(x_{1},{\ldots},x_{n})$ and $\sum{}x$
  means
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aethecux}
    \sum{}x=x_{1}+{\ldots}x_{n}
  \end{equation}
Often, we write $\mu$ for the mean of a
  population and $\bar{x}$ for the mean of a sample.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Frequency Distributions}
Often, data is provided in the form of a frequency distribution. For
example, when I asked a class of statistics students about the number
of countries they had visited in their lifetime, the response was as
follows (given as an R command),
\begin{alltt}
\small
cn<-c(5,4,7,3,6,4,3,4,2,4,4,2,4,3,2,4,4)
\end{alltt}
A more intelligible way to display the data is to provide a frequency
distribution.
\begin{alltt}
> table(cn)\newline
cn\newline
2 3 4 5 6 7 \newline
3 3 8 1 1 1
\end{alltt}
There are 3 people who have been to 2 countries, 3 people who have
been to 3 countries, 8 people who have been to 4 countries, 1 person
who has been to 5 countries, and so on.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Calculating the Mean from a Frequency Distribution}
If you have a frequency distribution (usually of a sample, so we will
call the mean $\bar{x}$), the mean is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eogheivi}
  \bar{x}=\frac{\sum{}\left(f\cdot{}x\right)}{\sum{}f}
\end{equation}
For the example in the last slide,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:uevuemoo}
  \bar{x}=\frac{2\cdot{}3+3\cdot{}3+4\cdot{}8+5\cdot{}1+6\cdot{}1+7\cdot{}1}{3+3+8+1+1+1}\approx{}3.82
\end{equation}
In R, you can also simply use the command \texttt{mean}. Notice that
\texttt{mean(x)} and \texttt{sum(x)/length(x)} will give you the same
number.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Exercises}
  {\ubung} Find the mean of the following five counts for Chips Ahoy
  chocolate chip cookies: 22 chips, 22, chips, 26 chips, 24 chips, and
  23 chips.

  \bigskip

  {\ubung} Anne measures the temperature in her walk-in freezer. She
  measures $-23^{\circ}$C once; $-22^{\circ}$C 31 times;
  $-21^{\circ}$C 13 times; $-20^{\circ}$C 7 times; $-18^{\circ}$C
  twice. What is the mean temperature given this dataset?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measures of Centre: Median}
The median is the value in the middle. If there is an even number of
data points, the median is the mean of the two data points in the
middle. To find the median, sort the data points. For example, the
numbers of countries visited are

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
2&2&2&3&3&3&4&4&\alert{4}&4&4&4&4&4&5&6&7 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\medskip

The value in the middle is the number 4, which is also the median of
the data. It is quite similar to the mean, which is approximately 3.82.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Difference Between Mean and Median}
Imagine we had one more student in the class who was a world traveler.
She had visited 112 countries! The mean is now
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:zephahwu}
  \bar{x}=\frac{\sum{}x}{n}=\frac{177}{18}\approx{}9.83
\end{equation}
A mean of 9.83 is no longer a good summary of the data. Let's see if
the median does better.

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
2&2&{\ldots}&4&4&\alert{4}&\alert{4}&4&{\ldots}&6&7&112 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\medskip

The new median is $(4+4)/2=4$, which is a much better summary of the
data, pretty much ignoring the outlier.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measures of Dispersion: Motivation}
Have a look at these two different data sets.
\begin{alltt}
x1<-c(12,12,12,12,12,12,11,12,12,13,12,12,12,12)
\end{alltt}
and
\begin{alltt}
x2<-c(15,10,14,7,17,15,11,18,12,12,15,9,7,6)
\end{alltt}
The mean of both data sets is 12. The median of both data sets is 12.
However, something about these two data sets is different. \texttt{x2}
is more dispersed than \texttt{x1}, which means that the data is
spread out more. There is more variation in \texttt{x2}. We try to
capture this variation by finding measures of dispersion.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measures of Dispersion: Absolute Value of Deviation}
The difference between data points and the mean always sums to zero!
That is not helpful. If we want to make this measure of dispersion
more useful, we need to sum the \alert{absolute value of deviation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:riquithu}
  \mbox{mean absolute deviation }=\frac{\sum{}\vert{}x-\bar{x}\vert}{n}
\end{equation}
For our examples \texttt{x1} and \texttt{x2}, the mean absolute
deviations are 2 and 44, respectively. Although at first glance this
measure of dispersion looks useful, it makes for very complicated
calculations that can be simplified by choosing a different way to
make all the distances between data points and mean positive: not the
absolute value, but the square of the distance.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measures of Dispersion: Variance}
The \alert{variance} is calculated as follows,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:roongeef}
   \mbox{variance of a population }=\sigma^{2}=\frac{\sum{}(x-\mu)^{2}}{n}
\end{equation}
Something odd happens when we take the variance of a sample. If we
were to use equation (\ref{eq:roongeef}) to calculate the sample
variance for all possible samples of a population, the mean of these
sample variance would not equal the population variance. This means
that in this case the sample variance would be a \alert{biased
  estimator} of the population variance. We don't want that! To
correct for this problem and define a sample variance which is an
\alert{unbiased estimator} of the population variance, we introduce
\alert{Bessel's correction} and define
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ilosoama}
   \mbox{variance of a sample }=s^{2}=\frac{\sum{}(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Measures of Dispersion: Standard Deviation}
One disadvantage of the variance is that it is not an intuitive
measurement of dispersion. If we take the square root of the variance,
then we get something similar to the absolute value of deviation,
which tells us approximately how far on average the data points are
from the mean. We call this measurement the \alert{standard
  deviation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:boolaesh}
   \mbox{standard deviation of a population }=\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum{}(x-\mu)^{2}}{n}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:xeiroong}
   \mbox{standard deviation of a sample }=s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum{}(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}}
\end{equation}
Why we still sometimes prefer the variance will become
clear on the next slide. The standard deviation, whether with or
without Bessel's Correction, is a biased estimator!
\end{frame}

\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Calculating the Variance I}
It is easiest to calculate the variance using statistical software. In
R Studio, for example,
\begin{alltt}
> var(x1)\newline
[1] 0.1538462\newline
> var(x2)\newline
[1] 14.76923
\end{alltt}
and
\begin{alltt}
> sd(x1)\newline
[1] 0.3922323\newline
> sd(x2)\newline
[1] 3.843076
\end{alltt}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Calculating the Variance II}
When you do have to calculate the variance by hand, it is helpful to
use the following shortcut formula,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eecheaxe}
s^{2}=\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}=\frac{\sum{}x^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum{}x\right)^{2}}{n}}{n-1}
\end{equation}
because you do not have to keep entering the mean, which may contain
numerous significant digits.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Variance for a Frequency Distribution I}
Consider the data set \texttt{x3}
\begin{alltt}
4,4,2,2,4,3,3,3,1,4,4,1,2,2,2,4,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,2,3,3,3
\end{alltt}
We can summarize the data in a frequency distribution
\begin{alltt}
> table(x3)\newline
x3\newline
1 2 3 4 \newline
5 9 8 6 
\end{alltt}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Variance for a Frequency Distribution II}
Remember that in equation (\ref{eq:eogheivi}) we calculated the mean using a
formula for the frequency distribution,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:beingeip}
  \bar{x}=\frac{\sum{}\left(f\cdot{}x\right)}{\sum{}f}
\end{equation}
We can do the same for the variance and the standard deviation,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:iefoopoo}
  s^{2}=\frac{\sum{}\left(f\cdot{}x^{2}\right)-\frac{\left(\sum{}f\cdot{}x\right)^{2}}{\sum{}f}}{\sum{}f-1}
\end{equation}
Remember that $n=\sum{}f$.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Definitions}
  \begin{description}
  \item[event] An event is any collection of results or outcomes of a
    procedure.
  \item[sample space] The sample space for a procedure consists of all
    possible simple events. That is, the sample space consists of all
    outcomes that cannot be broken down any further. The symbol for
    the sample space is $\Omega$. 
  \item[complement] The complement of event $A$ is $\urcorner{}A$ and
    consists of all outcomes in which $A$ does not occur.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Logic and Sets I}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item<1-> $A\vee{}B$ is the event ``either $A$ or $B$ happens.''
  \item<2-> $A\wedge{}B$ is the event ``both $A$ and $B$ happens.''
  \item<3-> $\urcorner{}A$ is the event ``$A$ does not happens.''
  \item<4-> $\Omega$ and $\emptyset$ are events; they are called
    `tautology' and `contradiction,' respectively.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Logic and Sets II}
  The logical statement $A\vee{}B$ corresponds to the union of sets
  $A\cup{}B$ if $A$ and $B$ are understood as sets of simple events.

\medskip

  The logical statement $A\wedge{}B$ corresponds to the intersection of sets
  $A\cap{}B$ if $A$ and $B$ are understood as sets of simple events.

\medskip

Events $A$ and $B$ are \alert{disjoint} (or \alert{mutually
  exclusive}) if they cannot occur together. In set theory, we can
express this by saying that they are disjoint if and only if
$A\cap{}B=\emptyset$.

Think of dice rolls as an example. $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Event $A$
may be $\{1,2,3\}$, and event $B$ may be $\{2,4,6\}$. What, then, are
events $A\cup{}B$ and $A\cap{}B$?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Definition of Probability}
Let $\Omega$ be a set of simple events. An event $A$ is then a subset
of $\Omega$. A function $P$ from the collection of all these subsets
(sometimes called the power set of $\Omega$) to the real numbers is a
\alert{probability function} if the following three conditions are
fulfilled.
\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> $P(A)\geq{}0$ for all events $A$.
\item<2-> $P(\Omega)=1$.
\item<3->
  $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)$
  for any collection of disjoint events $A,B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Basic Theorems of Probability}
Here are some basic theorems that follow from the conditions.
\begin{block}{Rule of Complementary Events}
  $P(\urcorner{}A)=1-P(A)$\mbox{ for all events }A
\end{block}
This immediately implies that $P(\emptyset)=0$ since
$\emptyset=\urcorner\Omega$.
\begin{block}{Addition Rule}
  $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{}B)$
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conditional Probability}
Conditional probability of $A$ conditional on $B$ is defined as follows,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:iekeengi}
  P(B|A)=\frac{P(A\cap{}B)}{P(A)}
\end{equation}
This theorem follows immediately,
\begin{block}{Multiplication Rule}
  $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)\cdot{}P(B|A)$
\end{block}
Two events $A$ and $B$ are \alert{independent} if and only if
$P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)\cdot{}P(B)$. Given the multiplication rule, this is
equivalent to saying that $P(A|B)=P(A)$ and $P(B|A)P(B)$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Rules}
  \begin{block}{Addition Rule}
    When $A$ and $B$ are \emph{disjoint}, then
    $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)$; otherwise use
    $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{}B)$
\end{block}
\bigskip
\begin{block}{Multiplication Rule}
  When $A$ and $B$ are \emph{independent}, then
  $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)\cdot{}P(B)$; otherwise use
  $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A|B)\cdot{}P(B)$

  \frametitle{How to Solve Probability Problems}
In summary, here are some strategies to solve probability problems.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Count simple events. If the simple events are all equally
  probable, then the probability of event $A$ is the number of simple
  events in $A$ divided by the total number of simple events, so
  $P(A)=\#A/\#\Omega$.
\item Make sure to watch for independence and mutual exclusion.
  Whenever events are independent or mutually exclusive (disjoint),
  you can use $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)P(B)$ or $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)$,
  respectively.
\item If events are not mutually exclusive, you can use the
  addition rule $P(A\cup{}B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{}B)$.
\item If events are not independent, you can use conditional
  probabilities in $P(A\cap{}B)=P(A)P(B|A)$.
\item If you are dealing with events that are independent and
  mutually exclusive, it is often useful to draw a tree diagram.

  \frametitle{Multiplication Rule}
  Remember the thief who wants to crack the four-digit PIN of a bank
  card. Let $A$ be the event that she successfully cracks the PIN. If
  $A_{1}$ is the event that she succeeds on her first attempt (and so
  on for $A_{2}$ and $A_{3}$), then
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ragheidu}
  P(A)=P(A_{1}\cup{}A_{2}\cup{}A_{3})=P(A_{1})+P(A_{2})+P(A_{3})=0.003
\end{equation}
because $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}$ are disjoint. We are assuming that her
attempts happen \alert{without replacement}. Therefore,
$A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}$ are not independent, and the correct application of
the multiplication rule is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mohghunu}
  P(A)=1-P(\urcorner{}A)=\notag
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:yoobaegh}
  1-P(\urcorner{}A_{1})\cdot{}P(\urcorner{}A_{2}|\urcorner{}A_{1})\cdot{}P(\urcorner{}A_{3}|\urcorner{}A_{1}\cap{}\urcorner{}A_{2})=0.003

unconditional probabilities. To express one by the other use the
\alert{law of total probability},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:aefengah}
  P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|\urcorner{}B)P(\urcorner{}B)
\end{equation}
This formula also applies when you split up $B$ into three or more
disjoint subsets that exhaust $B$. It follows from set theory.

\textbf{Example: }Suppose that two factories supply light bulbs to the
market. Factory X's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 99\% of cases,
whereas factory Y's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 95\% of cases.
It is known that factory X supplies 60\% of the total bulbs available.
What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than
5000 hours?
% Now we should be able to answer the question from last week: How many
% four digit numbers are there with no repeating digits?

  In a city of 1 million inhabitants let there be 100 terrorists and

  all people present in the city are inhabitants. Thus, the base rate
  probability of a randomly selected inhabitant of the city being a

  inhabitant being a non-terrorist is 0.9999. In an attempt to catch
  the terrorists, the city installs an alarm system with a
  surveillance camera and automatic facial recognition software.

The software has two failure rates of 1\%:

  will ring 99\% of the time, and it will fail to ring 1\% of the

  \frametitle{Bayes' Formula}
Consider the definition of conditional probability,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ohyeweeb}
  P(B|A)=\frac{P(B\cap{}A)}{P(A)}
\end{equation}
Now notice that $P(B\cap{}A)=P(A\cap{}B)=P(B)P(A|B)$. That means that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:maifiepu}
  P(B|A)=\frac{P(B)P(A|B)}{P(A)}
\end{equation}
By the law of total probability we can replace the denominator to give
us \alert{Bayes' Formula}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ohrughai}
  P(B|A)=\frac{P(B)P(A|B)}{P(A|B)P(B)+P(A|\urcorner{}B)P(\urcorner{}B)}

Here are some definitions.
\begin{description}
\item[random variable] A random variable is a variable (typically
  represented by $X$) that has a single numerical value, determined by
  chance, for each outcome of a procedure.
\item[probability distribution] A probability distribution is a
  description that gives the probability for each value of the random
  variable. It is often expressed in the format of a table, formula,
  or graph.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Probability Distributions: Discrete and Continuous}
\begin{description}
\item[discrete random variable] A \alert{discrete} random variable has
  a collection of values that is finite or countable.
\item[continuous random variable] A \alert{continuous} random variable has
  infinitely many values, and the collection of values is not
  countable.
\item[countability] This is best explained by example: the integers
  are countable, but the real numbers are not.
\end{description}

  If there are a finite number of outcomes $X=a_{k}$ for
  $k=1,\ldots,n$, we can list the values of $P(X=a_{k})$ in a table.

distribution a \alert{uniform distribution}.

  \frametitle{Mean and Variance Formulas}
There is a sense in which a probability distribution together with its
associated random variable correspond to a population and the property
which the random variable picks out. In this spirit, let us define a
mean and a variance for a probability distribution.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:noohahfa}
  \mu=\sum{}X\cdot{}P(X)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:axiengeb}
  \sigma^{2}=\sum(X-\mu)^{2}\cdot{}P(X)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:teeneilu}
  \sigma^{2}=\sum(X^{2}\cdot{}P(X))-\mu^{2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:iifiekai}
  \sigma=\sqrt{\sum(X^{2}\cdot{}P(X))-\mu^{2}}
\end{equation}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Die Roll Example}
\beispiel{Fair Die Roll}\label{ex:reinooth} Think of rolling a fair die
many times. The probability distribution is uniform. The mean is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:isiamaih}
   \mu=\sum{}X\cdot{}P(X)=1\cdot{}\frac{1}{6}+2\cdot{}\frac{1}{6}+3\cdot{}\frac{1}{6}+4\cdot{}\frac{1}{6}+5\cdot{}\frac{1}{6}+6\cdot{}\frac{1}{6}=3.5\notag
\end{equation}
We also call this number the \alert{expectation} $EX$ of the random
variable $X$. Although you would never expect a die roll to result in
``3.5,'' you would expect the mean of many die rolls to be close to
this number. The expected number of boys for one birth is $EX=0.5$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Binomial Probability Distribution}
A \alert{binomial probability distribution} results from a procedure
that meets the following requirements.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The procedure has a fixed number of trials.
\item The trials must be independent.
\item The outcomes of a trial are binary, i.e.\ there are only two
  possible outcomes.
\item The probability of the two outcomes remains constant.
\end{enumerate}
The number of trials is usually labeled $n$, the two outcomes are
called \alert{success} and \alert{failure}, and their probabilities on
one trial are $p$ and $1-p$. The random variable keeps track of the
number of successes. If, for example, there are 10 trials, then
$P(X=4)$ is the probability of 4 successes out of 10. The number of
successes is often labeled $x$, and we are usually interested in
$P(X=x)$.
