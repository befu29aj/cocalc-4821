\textbf{Term Test B Instructions}

Some rules for the term test:
\begin{itemize}
\item I will probably reseat you in random order.
\item You are only allowed to leave the classroom (for example, to go
  to the bathroom) if no one else has left the classroom. Ask for
  permission to leave. 
\item You are not allowed to submit your test to the instructor and
  leave the classroom for the first 45 minutes.
\item All electronic devices must be turned off except for a
  calculator. I recommend using a calculator with matrix functions.
\item If you commit an act of academic dishonesty, I will take your
  case to the dean.
\item You are graded on the steps that lead to your results. Correct
  results with incorrect or missing work to get to the results do not
  earn points.
\end{itemize}

Here is the material covered for term test B:
\begin{description}
\item[Vectors] solve word problems involving linear combinations,
  span, linear independence, basis, dimension; calculate dot product, length and
  angles associated with vectors; find plane equations and tangent
  planes; solve dependent or underdetermined systems of linear
  equations; calculate the cross product and use it to find plane equations.
\item[Projection] find the projection of a vector onto a hyperplane;
  calculate the distance of a vector from a hyperplane; find the
  regression line for paired data; linearize a non-linear function
  using the Jacobian.
\end{description}
